**Nova** is an applied self-driving vehicle project made up of undergrads at the University of Texas at Dallas. We post updates, videos, and more on our website, https://nova-utd.github.io.

We're always interested in new members. We typically open recruitment each fall, but you can reach us any time on our [contact page](http://nova-utd.github.io/contact).
